# Welcome to SinkingYachts! :material-sail-boat:


## About

SinkingYachts is a cybersecurity project focused on providing resources and services that improve safety across Discord.

At the moment, the project's only service is the anti-phishing API. I plan to launch more services and resources as the
project grows.

SinkingYachts projects are developed, maintained, hosted, and funded by [nwunder#4003](https://nwunder.com).
