## Anti-Phishing API

SinkingYachts is home to an API allowing easy access to our phishing-domain database.

Features:
- Live updates from the [Fish Project](https://discordresources.com/wiki/resources/unofficial-servers#the-fish-project)
- Ability to fetch whole database or compare a domain against known phishing domains.
- "Recent updates" endpoint at ``/recent`` for updating database mirrors without the need to poll ``/all``.
- WebSocket feed for services that want to receive live database updates.
- High rate limit (see API docs)
