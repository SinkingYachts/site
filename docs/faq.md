## What's with the name?

I actually bought this domain before starting any of these projects. I initially bought it
with the intention of using it as a joke, perhaps with pictures of actual sinking yachts or
something. When I decided to host an anti-phishing API, I remembered this unused domain and
thought it'd be cool to use for that.

Since then, the name has grown on me, and I thought it'd be fun to use it for my branding
as I began to centralize my anti-phishing projects.
